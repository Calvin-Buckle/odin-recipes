    <li>4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
     <li>1/2 cup (99g) vegetable oil</li>
     <li>3/4 cup (149g) granulated sugar</li>
     <li>3/4 cup (163g) light brown sugar or dark brown sugar, packed</li>
     <li>2 teaspoons King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
     <li>1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, optional</li>
     <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon (14g) cider vinegar</li>
     <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>

    <li>2 2/3 cups (454g) semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the butter, oil, sugars, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Beat in the vinegar, egg, baking soda, and baking powder. Stir in the whole wheat flour, then the chocolate chips.
        <li>The dough will appear oily, and because of the quantity of chocolate chips, it won't be completely cohesive; that's OK.</li>
        <li>Drop the dough, by tablespoonfuls, onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, until the cookies are an even golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, and allow to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Store in a cookie jar for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to a month.</li>
